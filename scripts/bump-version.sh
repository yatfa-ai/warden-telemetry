# Bump the patch version in package.json, commit, tag vX.Y.Z, and push to main.
#
# Mirrors warden's scripts/bump-version.sh (same Node-project shape: the version
# lives in package.json, not a VERSION file), which in turn mirrors yatfa's.
# Differences for this repo:
#   - warden-telemetry DOES have a `prod` deploy-mirror branch, so unlike warden
#     this is bump-only: release.yml fast-forwards prod itself, right after
#     calling this script. Keeping the prod push there means the daily scheduled
#     run and the manual run share one code path.
#
# Strategy carried over verbatim: must be on main with a clean tree, patch-only
# bump, commit "bump: X -> Y", pull --rebase + push with up to 3 retries.
#
# When run inside GitHub Actions (GITHUB_OUTPUT set), exports `version` and
# `tag` to the step's job outputs. Locally it just prints the new version.
